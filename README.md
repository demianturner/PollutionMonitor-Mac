# PollutionMonitor-Mac
Status bar app for macOS using [aqicn][1] data to display pollution AQI readings.

This is the source for the PollutionMonitor app: [https://itunes.apple.com/app/concurrency/id738872892][2] - enjoy!

Just so we're clear, I'm releasing this so you can study it and learn how to make apps (or how not to make them, depending on what you think of my code).

This is not an invitation to take my app and release it unmodified (or mostly unmodified) under your own name. If you do that, I will find you ಠ\_ಠ.

The source is licensed under the [GNU GPLv3][3], which means you can copy the source and even sell apps derived from it, but you have to make available the source code of any programs you sell.

## API Key
You will need to get your own API key, see [here][4] and [here][5].
